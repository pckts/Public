These scripts are relatively recent in terms of technology and relevancy
I don't generally maintain my scripts beyond their intended lifetime, but scripts in this repo are expected to work still


However I don't actively monitor if they still work, and I manually transfer scripts to Archive when I find that they've broken or become irrelevant.
